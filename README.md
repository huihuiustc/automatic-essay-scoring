# Automatic Essay Scoring for Indonesian Language with K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
This application created for experiment for final project on Politeknik Negeri Bandung 2017.
This final project focus on compare two method for term weighting:
  1. Unsupervised Term Weighting : Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
  2. Supervised Term Weighting   : Term Frequency - Chi Square (TF-ChiÂ²)
                                   Term Frequency - Relevance Frequency (TF-RF)

This application use Multiple K-Fold Cross Validation for estimating accuracy of Automatic Scoring on Essay, with value of K is 2 - 10. Accuracy obtained for comparing score given by human rater and score given by application.
This project using K-Nearest Neighbor as Classification Algorithm, with K of KNN value is 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9
